# Lights Out - React Game
Lights Out is a game built using React. 
The idea of the game is to turn all of the lights on by clicking each tile. 
When a tile is clicked, it will toggle all of the adjacent tiles.
Once all lights are on, the player should receive a `Success` message and the game would be over.

Run `npm start`
Once you have the server running, you should be able to access it at `http://localhost:3000` for local development.

## Planning
In order to get started on the project, I used [Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2466516).
My thought process here was to break down the game into stories, which allowed me to work on smaller pieces of the game at a time.
